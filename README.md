# Product Requirements Document: Onchain Credit Score Builder Loans

## Executive Summary

### Product Vision
An innovative decentralized platform that helps individuals build verifiable credit histories on the blockchain through structured credit builder loans, creating financial inclusion for the underbanked while generating sustainable revenue through various service fees and marketplace opportunities.

### Problem Statement
Over 1.7 billion adults worldwide lack access to financial services due to missing credit histories. Traditional credit scoring systems are opaque, centralized, and inaccessible to many.  
This creates a paradoxical barrier: without credit history, individuals cannot access loans; without loans, they cannot build credit history.

### Solution Overview
Our platform solves this problem by creating a transparent, blockchain-based credit building system where users can establish verifiable financial reputations through a structured process:

- Deposit collateral into a smart contract
- Make regular payments over time
- Build a transparent credit history
- Access progressively better financial opportunities

## User Journey & Core Process

### 1. User Registration
- Connect blockchain wallet
- Complete basic KYC verification (adjustable based on regulatory requirements)
- Review and accept platform terms

### 2. Credit Builder Loan Process

#### Step 1: Collateral Deposit
- User deposits a specific amount (e.g., $100 in stablecoins) into a smart contract.
- Collateral is locked for the duration of the credit building period.
- Deposit amount determines the loan amount (typically 1:1 ratio).

#### Step 2: Loan Creation
- Smart contract automatically creates a "credit builder loan" equal to the collateral amount.
- Example: $100 loan at 8% APR over 12 months.
- Monthly payment: approximately **$8.67**.
- Payment schedule is established and visible to the user.

#### Step 3: Payment Process
- User makes monthly payments of $8.67 for 12 months (total: ~$104).
- Each payment includes principal repayment plus interest.
- Payments are made directly from the user's wallet to the smart contract.
- Payments recorded on-chain as verifiable transactions.
- On-time payments positively impact the user's credit score.
- Late/missed payments negatively impact the credit score and may incur penalties.

#### Step 4: Loan Completion
- After all payments, the smart contract returns the original $100 collateral.
- Platform retains the interest (~$4) as revenue.
- User receives:
  - Final credit score
  - Completed loan certificate (NFT)
